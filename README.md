# ðŸ™ˆ Highlight Monkey

Hugo comes with a built-in `{{< highlight >}}` shortcode that worksâ€¦ ok on a Micro.blog site. But not without its quirks. This plug-in aims to monkey patch in better code-highlighting support for microbloggers.

As of now, this plug-in is not even alpha. It's a proof of concept.

## Install the plug-in

1. [Follow this link](https://micro.blog/account/themes/new?plugin=1) or manually go to *Design* â†’ *Edit Custom Themes* and press *New Plug-in*.
3. Enter a fitting *Title* (like Highlight Monkey).
4. Paste the following into *Clone URL*:
```
https://github.com/svendahlstrand/plugin-highlight-monkey
```
5. Choose which *Site* you want to install the plug-in.
6. Press *Add Plug-in*
7. Congratulations, the plug-in is installed.

## Try it out!

1. First of all, wait for the plug-in to be installed. It can take a couple of minutes based on Micro.blog's load.
2. Then, go highlight some code! The [`{{< highlight >}}Â´ shortcode syntax is documented here](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/).
3. Report quirks to me. ðŸ‘‡
